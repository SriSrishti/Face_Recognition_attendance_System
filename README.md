**Face Recognition Attendance System** 🖥️📸

This project is a Face Recognition-Based Attendance System built using Python, OpenCV, and Face Recognition libraries. It automates the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces from a live camera feed or images.

✨ Features
✅ Real-time face detection and recognition
✅ Automatic attendance marking in CSV file
✅ User-friendly GUI using Tkinter
✅ Supports adding new faces to the database
✅ Efficient and fast face recognition using dlib's deep learning model

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Face Recognition Library (dlib)
NumPy & Pandas
Tkinter (for GUI)
🚀 How It Works
The system captures a live video stream or processes stored images.
It detects and recognizes registered faces using the Face Recognition library.
If a recognized face matches a registered user, their attendance is marked with a timestamp.
The attendance is saved in a CSV file for further processing.
